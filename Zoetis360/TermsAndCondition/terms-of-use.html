                                  Policy at any time without notice to you. You should regularly review these Terms for any modifications or amendments as your continued use of the Application after a modification or amendment
                                   signifies your assent and agreement to these Terms, as amended. If any clause or provision set forth in these Terms is determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future law,
